 #PhishFinder
 ## This software will work to prevent phishing using means of data mining and associative classification algorithms

 Overview
This product is for anyone browsing the web. Having a tool like this easily available would make it easier for the average person to protect themselves online by alerting them 
to potentially dangerous websites. Internet safety is always a prevalent issue, so there is always a market for tools like this. The product, ‘AngelPhish’, is a web extension 
tool that will identify the likelihood of a website trying to phish for your information as well as categorize each site as “Unsafe,” “Safe,” or “Unsure.” It will complete this 
task by using a machine learning algorithm based on certain website identifiers. The algorithm will use linear regression based on certain website attributes, such as URL length, 
and give the website a value that corresponds with the level of confidence of the website being phished. The product is different from any other anti-phishing services because there 
are no other Chrome extensions that provide this service. Most other products relate directly to email safety, while ours would focus on detecting fraudulent websites. We are using academic 
articles, forums, and other online resources to build our product. One academic article we will be referring to is ‘Phishing detection based Associative Classification data mining’. This article 
discusses the use of a data mining technique called Associative Classification that will intelligently filter phishing websites without using blacklists. Associative Classification extracts
website properties and makes inferences on whether or not a website is safe with a high degree of accuracy. We will be exploring this and other techniques to find what will work best for our
project. We are very excited to be working on this project.
